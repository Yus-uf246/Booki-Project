Hello, 

I hope you are well, this is a website created using html & CSS, I have not used sass or JavaScript for this project. However, I have used sass and JavaScript within my other projects. This website is fully responsive to any screen size, it is a holiday website designed to allow you to book a holiday. 

On the desktop and tablet version of this website a border at the top appears when you click the accommodations and activities links. On the mobile version the border appears at the bottom of the two links when you click on them.
Thank you very much for taking the time to view my website.

Kind Regards 

Yusuf
